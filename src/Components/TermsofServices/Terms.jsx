                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>All Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the rules and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. You can find the JAMS rules and procedures here at this link: https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (2) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, NY Times Building, 620 8th Ave, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018; and (3) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration to EmpowerCare at 562 Lincoln St Worcester, MA 01605, ATTN: Legal Department.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, each party will pay an equal share of all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Location of Arbitration: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the arbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in Boston, Massachusetts. If you live outside the United States, you must initiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in Boston, Massachusetts. Either party may ask that the arbitration including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted telephonically or by video conference (e.g., Skype).</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy or any additional policy of EmpowerCare, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of such is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial and are waiving that right. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND EMPOWERCARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S). CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION.</p>
