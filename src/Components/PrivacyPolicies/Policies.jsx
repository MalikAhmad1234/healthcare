                                <p>This policy was implemented as of April 7, 2021 and applies to information collected on this website and those of our affiliates (together, “our website” or “the website”) and covers the following areas:</p>

                                <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
                                <p>EMPOWERCARE collects two different types of information through our website: anonymous information and personally identifiable information.</p>

                                <li style={{ marginLeft: '2rem' }}>  <p style={{ fontWeight: '600' }}>Anonymous Information </p></li>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}> We collect and store anonymous, aggregate information (such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, search engines, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks) from all visitors to our website. You may search our website for Services and other information provided through our website without ever submitting your name, email address or any other personally identifiable information. The anonymous information that we do collect from your visit is never linked to any of your personally identifiable information until you voluntarily submit that personal information, in which case some otherwise anonymous information may be connected to your website activity and personal account. Otherwise, the anonymous information is only used in the aggregate to analyze trends, administer the website, diagnose any problems, track a visitor’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may provide this anonymous information in aggregate form to other parties or use it for our own insight or marketing purposes. Our ability to use this information is not restricted in any way.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>We also use “cookies” and “image tags” to collect certain usage information from all customers and visitors to our website. A “cookie” is a small text file that a website can place on your computer’s hard drive or on your mobile device’s memory in order to collect information about your activities on our website. An “image tag,” also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, works together with cookies and is a small image file that may be located in various areas of our website. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the option to change your browser setting to decline them.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Accepting cookies in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, since cookies are not used to identify anonymous website visitors. Our cookies enable you to proceed smoothly through our website and know whether you’ve used it before, so as to eliminate some steps that apply to new visitors. Cookies also give us usage data like how often you visit, where you go on our website, and what you do while here.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Further, with your permission, we may collect information about your use or interaction with our website or about the devices you use to connect or interact with our website by automated means, including tracking technologies. As discussed above, these tracking technologies may include “cookies,” which are small lines of text/data that are written onto your device by a website. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the website may not work properly. EMPOWERCARE and suppliers acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, beacons, web beacons, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi monitoring and other technologies to operate the website and to provide services. With your consent, we may also use technologies to capture your demographic information and engagement with us in order to present you with a more personalized experience.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
                                <li style={{ marginLeft: '2rem' }}>  <p style={{ fontWeight: '600' }}>Personally Identifiable Information </p></li>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>We require the submission of certain personally identifiable information when you use some Services available on our website, which may include, without limitation, (1) educational information, (2) employment history, (3) financial information, to the extent permitted by law, (4) family details (dependents, ages, marriage, prior marriage),  (5) Home address (current, past), home telephone, cell phone, (6) Social security status, (7) driver’s license, and (8) race/gender.  For example, your use of your user name and password allows us to identify you as our customer/applicant/canddiate who is seeking information in connection with our Services. Our website uses a variety of contact forms and tracking phone numbers for visitors to request information, products, and services. We collect a visitor’s contact information (like his or her email address or phone number) and in some cases, demographic information (like his or her zip code).  We use this information to get in touch with our prospective customers/applicants/candidates about their requests, and to send them additional information about our services.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Note that once you have elected to voluntarily provide personally identifiable information to us, we may use cookies to help identify you. Personally identifiable information received from you (such as IP address, phone number, email address, zip code, etc.) may be contained in or linked to a cookie. The only time that we receive such personally identifiable information is when you volunteer it by submitting it to us.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>We may use cookies with personally identifiable information so that our website can remember you, enhance your online visit with us, and provide you with the information you’re most likely to need. For instance, cookies allow our website to remind you of your past search interests and website activity and to suggest similar services. In some cases, cookies may improve your experience and we use information gained through cookies to track your website activity and to deliver you content specific information.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Any financial information we collect is used to check the qualifications of our prospective customers and bill for Services ordered. The collection, use and storage of your financial information for engaging our Services may be subject to additional privacy policies and if so, you will be notified of them at the time of any such collection, use or storage of your financial information as required by law.</p>
                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>Our online surveys may ask visitors for contact information (like an email address or phone number) which they may voluntarily provide. We also may run contests on our website in which we ask visitors for similar contact information in order to participate. We use contact information from our surveys and contests to send information about services to these participating visitors.</p>

EMPOWERCARE will never give or sell your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties to be used for the purposes of sending you unsolicited commercial offers, such as spam. We may, however, use your personal information to send you commercial offers in e-mails from EmpowerCare or its affiliated companies, which do not relate to the services you have requested. You may altogether avoid or opt out of these marketing campaigns (see “Opting Out” below).</p>
                           <p style={styles.paragraph}>We may also need to contact you for purposes other than marketing, for example to provide notice about the status of our website or the specific services you have requested. We also use this information to the extent necessary to enforce our website Terms of Use and to prevent imminent harm to persons or property. You may not opt-out of these kinds of communications. Consistent with our change policy (see “Your Consent and Notification of Changes” below), we will post any updates or notices about material changes in our policies on collection and use of your personally identifiable information to this Privacy Policy page.</p>
                            <p style={{fontWeight:'600'}}>Additionally, we may share your information for the following business and commercial purposes:</p>

Once we share your personal information in accordance with the foregoing, it is then controlled by that company or person and becomes subject to their privacy practices.</li>
                            <li>for compliance purposes like payment processing, tax purposes, and identity verification.</li>

                                <p style={styles.paragraph}>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by EmpowerCareinfringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.§ 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow EmpowerCare to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
